# Denon AVR

This is API server to control Denon AVR, and also telnet client for AVR.

## Denon AVR control protocol

AVR control protocol is published by official website. I've only tested
AVR-X2200W, but each version's control command is almost same. If you want to
see the detail please access to the [official document][0].
